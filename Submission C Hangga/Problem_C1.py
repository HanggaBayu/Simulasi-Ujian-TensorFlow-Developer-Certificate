# PROBLEM C1
#
# Given two arrays, train a neural network model to match the X to the Y.
# Predict the model with new values of X [-2.0, 10.0]
# We provide the model prediction, do not change the code.
#
# The test infrastructure expects a trained model that accepts
# an input shape of [1]
# Do not use lambda layers in your model.
#
# Please be aware that this is a linear model.
# We will test your model with values in a range as defined in the array to make sure your model is linear.
#
# Desired loss (MSE) < 1e-4
